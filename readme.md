## Buy a (Kirby) license

You can purchase your **Kirby license** at
<http://getkirby.com/buy>

A Kirby license is valid for a single domain. You can find
Kirby's license agreement here: <http://getkirby.com/license>

## The Cartkit

Cartkit comes with a small demo website and a fully
configured panel. Feel free to modify it and play with it as
much as you like.

## The Panel

You can find the login for Kirby's admin interface at
http://yourdomain.com/panel. You will be guided through the signup
process for your first user, when you visit the panel
for the first time.

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 5.3+, Apache or Nginx.

### With Git

If you are familiar with Git, you can clone Kirby's
Cartkit repository from Github.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/starckio/cartkit.git
